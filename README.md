## All About APIs Dreamforce16 Mini Hack #6 custom APEX REST API

##Challenge

An API is an interface through which one application communicates with other. Salesforce can be integrated with third party applications through a REST API. You need to create a REST Resource in your org such that you can use Salesforce REST APIs to update Salesforce data from outside the system.

##Requirements

1. This challenge requires a [Force.com Developer Edition](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup?d=70130000000td6N).
2. Create an Apex REST Resource in Salesforce such that you can access and modify Salesforce data through external system(that external system for this hack can be your machine terminal).
3. Refer to our [Apex Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_rest_code_sample_basic.htm) for reference and sample code.
4. Update the Rest Resource such that you are able to update a Contact’s description field as “Inactive Contact”.
5. You can use the sessionID for authentication instead of your username/password as shown in the sample code and demonstrate your solution by making the REST call to your ORG.
